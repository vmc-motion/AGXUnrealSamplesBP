5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
5.1 Licensee is aware of and accepts that the Product is and shall remain the property of Algoryx, or its licensor(s), and that nothing herein shall be construed as transferring any rights whatsoever in the Product from Algoryx to Licensee, except as expressly set out herein.


6. WARRANTY AND SUPPORT
6.1 To the extent the Term is longer than 90 days, Algoryx warrants that the Product has been tested and will function generally in accordance with the Product Documentation during a 90 (ninety) day warranty period following the Effective Date. Failure to so function shall mean a material failure   or   malfunction  capable   of   being   replicated  by Algoryx upon Licensee’s specifications and which prevents use of the Product as specified in the Product Documentation, or which provokes an incorrect action or result, although the Product is used by Licensee in full compliance with the Product Documentation or as otherwise directed by Algoryx and only with such other software or hardware as has been approved by Algoryx for use with the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Algoryx has no obligation whatsoever for errors in the Product caused by or related to any Third Party Products.

6.2 The warranty above in Section 6.1 shall only apply if;
(a) the Product is used under reasonable conditions and in accordance with the Product Documentation;
(b) Licensee, without  undue  delay,  has  given  Algoryx notice of any errors, defects, non-conformities or deviations of the Product and has provided a warranty fault report to Algoryx presenting a specification of the error, promptly after the error has been discovered by Licensee;
(c) any error, defect, non-conformity or deviation of the Product was not caused by inter-working equipment not supplied under this Agreement;
(d) any error, defect, non-conformity or deviation of the Product was not caused by Licensee’s use of the Product together with equipment, other than prescribed by Algoryx; and
(e) Licensee  has  given  Algoryx ample opportunity  to remedy such error, defect, non-conformity or deviation, including any reasonable workarounds suggested by Algoryx.

6.3 Algoryx warrants that it is the owner, or holder of licenses, of all intellectual property rights relating to the Product and has  the  full  power  and  right  to  license  the  Product  to Licensee.

6.4 The warranties set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.3 above are the only warranties made to Licensee and are provided in lieu of any other express warranties or similar obligations (if any) created by any advertising, documentation, packaging, or other  communications. Except  for  the  warrantied contained in Section 6.1 and 6.3 above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Algoryx provides the Product and support services (if any) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, and hereby disclaims all other warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any (if any) implied warranties, duties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, of reliability or availability, accuracy or completeness of responses, of results, of workmanlike effort, of lack of viruses, and of lack of negligence, all with regard to the Product, and the provision of or failure to provide support or other services, information, software, and related content through the Product or otherwise arising out of the use of the Product.

6.5 For Licenses with a valid Subscription License, Algoryx will provide Licensee with best-effort support through online communication over email, instant messaging or online video as devised by Algoryx, during Working Days and Office Hours. Algoryx is considered to be informed about errors, bugs and questions when Algoryx has received such qualified information into its devised error-report ticket handling system. Algoryx will acknowledge this with a receipt and have a response time on support which normally is within five (5) Working Days. Algoryx will firstly, if applicable, advise Licensee as to the intended, recommended and correct use of the Product that avoids such support issues. Secondly, Algoryx shall advise Licensee to upgrade to a later version of Product in case the support issue is corrected there. Thirdly, Algoryx shall apply best efforts in correcting support issues and prioritized bug-fixes in a forthcoming official release, and if this is not possible or feasible in time, Algoryx shall advise Licensee how to circumvent the error or defect, or Algoryx may at its own discretion chose to provide a patch or upgrade of Product that corrects the support issue.

6.6 Algoryx will only at its own discretion provide support for components or functionality that in source code or documentation are referred to as experimental, or work in progress. General training of Licensee personnel in using Product is not provided as part of the support, but offered as a separate service. Neither is integration with other tools, software and products included in the support, but offered as a separate service.

6.7 Increased levels of support, maintenance and services may be contracted by Licensee and Algoryx in an addendum to this Agreement, or in a separate service agreement.


7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY
7.1 Algoryx agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses arising as a result of or in connection with Algoryx’ breach of the warranty in Section 6.3 provided that Algoryx is given complete control of such claim, that Licensee does not prejudice Algoryx’ defense of such claim, that Licensee gives Algoryx all reasonable assistance with such claim at the cost of Algoryx and that the claim does not arise as a result of Licensee’s use of the Product in combination with any equipment not supplied or approved in writing by Algoryx or the use of the Product in conflict with this Agreement.


8. LIABILITY OF LICENSEE
Licensee shall be responsible for its activities related to the use of the Product. Licensee undertakes to indemnify and hold Algoryx harmless from any liability for Algoryx inflicted upon Algoryx, resulting from its unauthorised use of the Product or copies thereof by Licensee.


9. LIABILITY OF ALGORYX
Notwithstanding anything set out elsewhere in this Agreement, the following shall apply with regard to Algoryx’ liability under this Agreement;
(a) Other than the indemnity set forth in section 7 Algoryx’  entire  liability  and  Licensee’s  exclusive remedy for any breach of the warranties contained in Section 6 or any other breach of this Agreement or for any other liability relating to the Product shall be, at Algoryx’  option,  subject  to  applicable  law:  (i)  to repair, replace or modify the Product; or (ii) in the case of a breach of Section 6.3, to obtain a license from the infringed party, permitting the continued use of the Product. In the event Algoryx considers, at its sole discretion,  that  none  of  the  above  alternatives  is possible at a reasonable cost to Algoryx, then Licensee shall be obliged to stop using the Product (whereupon the Agreement shall be considered as terminated with immediate effect) and the Licensee will in such case as full and final compensation obtain a pro-rata refund of the price paid for the Product License Fee during the past year (12 months until date of termination of Agreement), based upon amortization of the License Fee on a straight-line basis over two (2) years from the Effective Date.
(b) Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, consequential, special  or  punitive  damages  arising from the provision of services hereunder such as commercial loss, loss of orders, any commercial disturbance, loss of profits, loss of data or third party claims, even if Algoryx has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Further, the liability of Algoryx for any and all causes with respect to the Product, breach of  contract,  warranty  or  otherwise, shall in aggregate not exceed the License Fee, unless such liability has been caused by any grossly negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of Algoryx.
(c) The parties acknowledge that the limitations and exclusions of liability are reasonable in the context of this Agreement and, in particular, recognise that the License Fee has been agreed on the basis of the limitations and exclusions of liability set out herein.


10. FORCE MAJEURE
Algoryx shall not be liable for any delay in performing its obligations if  such  delay  is  caused  by circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The performance of Algoryx obligations shall be suspended during the period that the said circumstances persist and Algoryx shall be granted an extension of time for performance equal to the period of the delay.


11. CONFIDENTIALITY

11.1   Licensee undertakes to treat as confidential and keep secret all information contained or embodied in the Product and Product Documentation (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Information”) provided that this Section shall not extend to any information which was rightfully in the possession of Licensee without confidentiality obligations prior to the commencement of the negotiations leading to this Agreement or which is already public knowledge or becomes so at a future date, without fault of Licensee (otherwise than as a result of a breach of this Section).

11.2 Licensee shall  not  without  the  prior  written  consent  of Algoryx divulge any part of the Information to any person except to (i) Licensee’s employees and third party consultants on a strict need to know basis, (ii) Licensee’s auditors and any other persons or bodies having a right, duty or obligation to know the business of Licensee and then only in pursuance of such right, duty or obligation, and (iii) any person who is from time to time appointed by Licensee to maintain any equipment on which the Product is being used (in accordance with the terms of the License) and then only to the extent necessary to enable such person properly to maintain such equipment.

===== COLAMD =====

    colamd:  An approximate minimum degree column ordering algorithm.

    Purpose:

	Colamd computes a permutation Q such that the Cholesky factorization of
	(AQ)'(AQ) has less fill-in and requires fewer floating point operations
	than A'A.  This also provides a good ordering for sparse partial
	pivoting methods, P(AQ) = LU, where Q is computed prior to numerical
	factorization, and P is computed during numerical factorization via
	conventional partial pivoting with row interchanges.  Colamd is the
	column ordering method used in SuperLU, part of the ScaLAPACK library.
	It is also available as user-contributed software for Matlab 5.2,
	available from MathWorks, Inc. (http://www.mathworks.com).  This
	routine can be used in place of COLMMD in Matlab.  By default, the
  \ and / operators in Matlab perform a column ordering (using COLMMD)
	prior to LU factorization using sparse partial pivoting, in the
	built-in Matlab LU(A) routine.

    Authors:

	The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.
	Davis (davis@cise.ufl.edu), University of Florida.  The algorithm was
	developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and Esmond
	Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

    Date:

	August 3, 1998.  Version 1.0.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
by all standard GIF decoders.

                    The FreeType Project LICENSE
                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
