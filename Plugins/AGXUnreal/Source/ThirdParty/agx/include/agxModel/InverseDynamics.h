  Class for computing forces/torques which can be used to reach a desired configuration.
  It can also be used to compensate for gravity by computing forces/torques needed to keep
  current pose and have zero velocity.

  This class is intended for use with constrained systems. There is also partial powerline support:
  - Gravity compensation can provide which force/torque that should be applied at a PowerLine Unit.
  - Trajectory computations via solve only provide value/gradient for specified powerline units
    and these units are not used to drive the motion.

  \note Controlling a powerline unit to control a constraint to reach a certain
        pose is likely to have worse precision compared to working on the contraints
        unless all the powerline connections are stiff.

        The InverseDynamics class is agnostic to what the powerline units actually
        represents and how the value and gradient should be used depends on the
        actual unit.
