  /**
  Single disk plate clutch with dry friction.  Input and output shafts are
  connected to plates with rough surfaces.  A spring loaded mechanism increases
  the normal force between the plates between a minimum and maximum, giving rise
  to the concept of torque capacity.  When the plates are at maximum distance
  from each other, no force is transmitted.  When they are at zero distance,
  maximum pressure is applied.

  Together with Coulomb friction, this keeps the plates rotating at nearly the
  same angular velocity untill the stick-slip transition is reached,
  alternately, when the torque required to move the output shaft at the same
  velocity as the input shaft reaches the torque capacity.  This happens when
  the load on the output shaft is too difficult to move.  If the two disks move
  relative to each other, this is called slipping so one can read the slip
  velocity at any time.

  The "opening fraction" here represents the value of the torque capacity in
  proportion to the maximum capacity, i.e., when the plates are fully closed,
  i.e., maximum normal force is achieved.  As for most clutches, this model
  includes a "locked" mode in which a clamp is activated to prevent any slip.
  This stays "ON" until the clutch is disengaged, or if the output shaft starts
  to move faster but in the same direction as the input shaft, as in the case of
  dynamic breaking.

  This model has two modes, namely, manual and automatic.  In the manual mode,
  the user is responsible to adjust the opening fraction, or set the lock
  mechanism directly. This can be done using a control algorithm and an event
  listener.  For the automatic mode, a time constant determines how long it
  takes to go from fully open to fully engaged.  The function "engage"
  determines whether we are ramping up or down.  Setting auto lock mode
  activates logic to activate or deactivate the lock according to simple logic.
  If the slip velocity is small in proportion of the input shaft velocity, the
  lock is activated.  If either "engage(false)" function is called or the torque
  between the places is negative -- dynamic braking -- then the lock is
  deactivated.


  The maximum available torque before slipping for a given opening fraction
  \f$f\f$ is `\f$fT_c\f$' where \f$T_c\f$ is the torque capacity defined by

  \f[
    T_c = 2\frac{2}{3}\mu\frac{r_2^3-r_1^3}{r_2^2-r_1^2}F
  \f]

  where \f$r_i\f$ are the outer and inner radii.  This defaults to a `reasonable'
  number corresponding to a passenger car, namely, around 40 Nm

  Automatic engagement makes the fraction increase linearly from the time the
  "engage(true)" function is called, or decreases linearly from the time the
  "engage(false)" is called.

  We assume that the pressure plate is a linear spring so that $F$ is
  directly proportional to it's position.
