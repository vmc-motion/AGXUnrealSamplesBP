\mainpage API Reference

\section intro Introduction

AGX Dynamics is a multi-physics engine written in platform independent C++.

AGX is built/tested on:

- Windows Windows 10; both 32 and 64 bit. Compilers: Visual studio 2017, 2019, 2022
- Linux, Ubuntu 18.04 (gcc 7.3.0), Ubuntu 20.04 (gcc 9.3.0), Ubuntu 22.04 (gcc 11.3.0)
- Mac OS X (clang 11.0.0)

AGX Dynamics is designed to be a modern, easy to use, object oriented API, with access to
efficient numerical implementations and different types of solvers depending on the circumstances.

The API is divided into a number of namespaces:

- \ref agx - contains the dynamic simulation part of the system.
- \ref agxCable - Simulate flexible cables/ropes
- \ref agxCollide - contains the geometric intersection system (collision detection).
the dynamical simulation system including Material, event listeners etc.
- \ref agxFMI2 - Functional Mockup Interface version 2.0
- \ref agxDriveTrain - Classes for building complete drive trains including clutches, gearboxes etc..
- \ref agxHydraulics - Classes for building hydraulic systems
- \ref agxIO - For reading/writing data
- \ref agxMex - Coupling to Matlab/Simulink
- \ref agxModel - Higher level modeling primitives such as Tree, Terrain.
- \ref agxNet - Network API
- \ref agxOSG - Utility classes for using AGX together with the rendering scene graph OpenSceneGraph. Not required.
- \ref agxPowerLine - Framework for building drivetrain components.
- \ref agxRender - Debug rendering and color classes
- \ref agxSensor - Gamepad/Joystick drivers
- \ref agxStream - contains classes for streaming data into archives for serialization.
- \ref agxSDK - contains classes to bridge the collision detection system and
- \ref agxTerrain - A terrain model based a 3D grid model with overlapping height field that can be deformed by interacting shovels objects performing digging motions, converting solid mass to dynamic mass which can be moved.
- \ref agxUtil - Utility classes.
- \ref agxVehicle - Classes for modelling vehicles
- \ref agxWire - API for creating wires with dynamic resolution.
