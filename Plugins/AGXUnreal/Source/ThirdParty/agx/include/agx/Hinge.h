  /**
  The hinge constraint between two rigid bodies or one rigid body
  and the world.

  The hinge constraint maintains a constant rotational axis between
  two rigid bodies and allows rotation about this axis.  By default,
  there is no control on the relative angle between the two bodies and
  in fact, the relative rotational angle is not computed.  By using
  the DOFController object and setting flags and other parameters, the
  relative angle can be computed.  It can also be limited to a given
  range, locked at a given value, or motorized using a velocity or a
  position constraint.  When a joint limit is reached, an inequality
  constraint is added to the system to enforce the joint limit.  If
  the motor or lock control is already turned ON, both constraints can
  be active, and it is up to the solver to compute the correct
  solution.

  When setting up the hinge constraint, the user can simply pass a
  HingeFrame object to the constraint.  The "Z" axis of the frame will then
  be used as the hinge axis.  This is not to say that the constraint
  will keep that axis in world coordinates, only that at the instant
  following configuration, the hinge axis will be coincident with the
  "Z" axis of the given frame.  Correspondingly, by default, the joint
  angle will be computed in the "XY" plane of the given frame so that
  zero angle corresponds to the hinge frame aligned along the original
  "X" axis.

  In addition, the configuration of the hinge can be done by setting
  the attachment frames of each of the bodies.  When doing that, the
  constraint will then operate to make the two "Z" axes parallel, and
  the origins of the two frames coincident.
