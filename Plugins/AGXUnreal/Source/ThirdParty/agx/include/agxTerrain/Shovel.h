  /**
  Shovel object used to interact with the terrain via an active zone that converts solid terrain to dynamic terrain
  which can be moved by the shovel rigid body.

  A shovel object consists of a rigid body and two edges, one top edge and a bottom cutting edge. These edges, which together
  with a fracture angle, constructs the active zone in front of the shovel object. As the shovel moves, the active zone converts
  solid mass into dynamic mass, consisting and internal fluid and particle mass. The dynamic mass is simulated in an internal
  simulation and is kinematically affected by objects that are added to it. The shovel receives feedback forces through a rigid
  body aggregate constructed from the inertia of soil particles in the active zone.
