  /**
  A pager that will dynamically handle terrain tiles in a agxSDK::Simulation.

  The pager uses a 2D-grid and populates the grid tiles with terrain instances as needed.
  There is a reference point which specifies the (0,0) position for the 2D-grid. There is
  also a reference rotation which should be used to map the grids local Z-axis to the up
  direction at the reference point.

  The reference point should be specified to be near the location in the world
  where the simulation is being performed.

  In a default created Simulation with uniform gravity, the reference rotation can
  be set to the identity matrix since AGX uses Z as default up axis. If the gravity direction
  is changed and e.g. the x-z plane is used for ground and y for up, then the rotation
  must be set accordingly.

  On the other hand, if the Simulation is being performed on a sphere (e.g Earth) with a
  point gravity source, then it is important that the working area is relatively close
  to the reference point. With Earths radius and a distance 10km away from the reference point,
  a height difference of a few meters can be observed due to Earths curvature. The approximation
  within the pager to work with a 2D-grid can handle these heigh differences within the different
  tiles without problem. But if the reference point is set at the north pole and the working area
  is near the equator problems will occur.

  To track which grid tiles that needs to have active terrain instances, one or more bodies
  are added to the TerrainPager. The world position for those bodies will be used
  to determine which tiles should be available.
  Along with the body position, two radiuses are used:
  - One radius for required tiles. These must be available for the simulation to step.
  This will add a small delay in the initial setup.
  - A second radius for preloading. The preloading radius should be larger than the
  required radius and is used so that tiles are made available before they are reached
  by the required radius. Preloaded tiles are inserted into the simulation when ready and
  the simulation can be stepped while the preloading occurs.


  Excavation in the Terrain works best when the excavation is being performed within a tile.
  Therefor tiles can have a margin so that they have a overlap to make the transition from one
  tile to the next work so the excavation is always kept within a single tile and never
  reaches a tile edge. This margin is specified via how many height values that should
  overlap.

  If margins larger than 0 are used, then this affects which data points from each tiles
  heightfield that should be used for rendering to avoid drawing the same part twice.

  NOTE:
  - The agxSDK::Simulation does not support that the update task is rebuilt during stepForward.
  - The TerrainPager must be able to add terrains to the simulation during stepForward.
  - Adding a terrain to the simulation will set some solver parameters and possibly cause
    the update task to be rebuilt.
  - Hence, simulation->add( terrainpager ) prepares the Simulation so that the update task
    will not be rebuilt when adding terrains.
  - It is NOT supported to change the following Solver parameters after a TerrainPager has been
    added to a Simulation: setUseParallelPgs, setUse32bitGranularBodySolver, setUseGranularWarmStarting
  - The Broadphase algorithm will be set to Hierarchical_Grid and it is NOT supported to change
    it back to Sweep-And-Prune.

    be set so that the excavation is performed within one tile and correct soil wedges
    are formed.

    Example: tileResolution = 301, tileOverlap 10, tileElementSize = 0.25, ....
