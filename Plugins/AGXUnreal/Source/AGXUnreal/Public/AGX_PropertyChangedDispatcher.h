/**
 * We identify properties by a (Member, Property) pair. Each such pair is associated with a
 * callback. "Member" is the name of the member on the UObject, the UObject on which
 * PostEditChangeProperty is called. "Property" is the first nesting of the member. This is used
 * when the member is a struct containing many properties and we only wish to update one at the
 * time.
 *
 * For properties directly on the UObject Member and Property will be the same.
 *
 * Note that for nesting deeper than two levels these doesn't directly correspond to the Member and
 * Property parameters passed to PostEditPropertyChanged. They are the first and last properties of
 * a nesting chain while here we store the first and second properties.
 *
 * For examples, consider Constraint1DofComponent > RangeController > Range > Min. Here Member would
 * be "RangeController" and Property would be "Range". The same callback would be called for Min and
 * Max, the other member of Range.
 *
 * The objects at the second level are typically small, such as vectors or ranges, so it is OK to
 * update them in whole. Some restructure of the UpropertyDispatcher will be required if we want
 * to use it for more granular callbacks. Most such cases can be handled directly in the Property
 * Changed callback, without going throught this Property Dispatcher.
 *
 * For immediate member structs that you want to handle with a single callback register a callback
 * on the Member name only and do not register any callback for the nested properties. This is
 * useful for Members that are e.g. a FVector where the (Member, Property) pair would be e.g.
 * (Velocity, X) but we might want to  update the entire velocity as a single chunk. Then add a
 * callback for just "Velocity" and not ("Velocity", "X") etc.
