/*
The documentation comment below describe our current understanding of the situation. These are the
cases we want to handle:
- An Actor or Component is created in the Level Viewport.
- An Actor or Component is created in a packaged application through application logic.
- An Actor or Component with a Component Reference member is loaded as part of a level load in
  the Unreal Editor.
- An Actor or Component with a Component Reference member is loaded as part of a level load in a
  packaged application.
- A new element is added to an array of structs containing a Component Reference from the
  Details panel.
- A Blueprint class adds elements to a Blueprint array of structs containing a Component
  Reference in the Construction Script.
- A new element is added to an array of structs containing a Component Reference using a function
  provided by the array-owning type.
- During Blueprint Reconstruction.

/**
 * A reference to a typed Component by name and owning Actor.
 *
 * The Component is identified by an Owning Actor pointer and the name of the Component. The type
 * is specified using an UClass, specifically TSubclassOf<UActorComponent>. Instances are meant to
 * be created as members of C++ classes, but the type is usable also from Blueprint Visual Scripts.
 *
 * There are multiple sub-classes of FAGX_ComponentReference that specify a more specific
 * Component type, for example FAGX_RigidBodyReference and FAGX_ShovelReference.
 *
 * The intention is that the Component Reference should be used much like Actor pointers are, but
 * limitations in the Unreal Editor with Components forces us to do some tricks and workarounds.
 * There is no Component picker UI, so the user must first pick an Actor that owns the Component and
 * then select the wanted component from a combo box of available names. There is no actual pointer
 * to the Component stored in the FAGX_ComponentReference, only the name, so renaming the component
 * will break the reference. This is a serious limitation. Also, while building a Blueprint Actor in
 * the Blueprint editor there is no actual Actor yet, so the Actor picker cannot be used to select
 * the Actor that will be created when the Blueprint is instantiated. In fact it cannot reference
 * any Actor. For this reason the Component Reference contains a Local Scope non-Property member
 * that is used as a fallback search Actor when Owning Actor is None / nullptr. All types that
 * contain a Component Reference member variable should set Local Scope to the Actor that it is
 * part of in the constructor. For Components use Get Typed Outer instead of Get Owner because the
 * Owner pointer may not have been set yet.
 *
 * void UMyComponent::UMyComponent()
 * {
 *     MyComponentReference.SetLocalScope(GetTypedOuter<AActor>());
 * }
 *
 * void AMyActor::AMyActor()
 * {
 *     MyComponentReference.SetLocalScope(this);
 * }
 *
 * This establishes the so-called local scope for the reference. Unless an Owning Actor is
 * specified, the reference will search within the Actor that the reference is contained within.
 *
 * The Local Scope must be maintained since Unreal Engine overwrites it from time to time. For
 * Components it is recommended to set it in the On Register virtual member function. This happens
 * after load so any data, including array elements, have been restored already, and it happens
 * after Blueprint Construction so any array elements created there will also be available. Also,
 * On Register is called both in editor and in packaged applications. For Actors it is recommended
 * to set it in the Pre Register All Components virtual member function.
 *
 * If the type contains Component References that are created dynamically, such as in an array,
 * then the Local Scope should be set on those in member functions that adds or sets elements in the
 * array. If elements can be added to the array from the Details panel then those new elements
 * should have the Local Scope set in Post Edit Change (Chain) Property.
 *
 * So in short, set Local Scope in:
 * - Constructor
 * - If Details panel editable array: Post Edit Change (Chain) Property.
 * - Any member function that adds or creates Component References, such as in an array.
 * - Actor Component: On Register
 * - Actor: Pre Register All Components.
 *
 *
 * A struct that both contains an FAGX_ComponentReference and has custom serialization code must
 * ensure that the garbage collector is made aware of the possible change in referencing the Owning
 * Actor. This is done by calling SerializeTaggedProperties also when
 * IsModifyingWeakAndStrongReferences is true. See FAGX_WireRoutingNode for an example or below
 * for the basics, and this Unreal Developer Network question:
 * https://udn.unrealengine.com/s/question/0D5QP000008jPSZ0A2/uproperty-aactor-target-set-to-nullptr-by-garbage-collector-after-compile-of-targets-blueprint-class
 *
 * bool FMyStruct::Serialize(FArchive& Archive)
 * {
 *     // Serialize the normal UPROPERTY data.
 *     if (Archive.IsLoading()
 *	       || Archive.IsSaving()
 *	       || Archive.IsModifyingWeakAndStrongReferences())
 *     {
 *         UScriptStruct* Struct = FMyStruct::StaticStruct();
 *         Struct->SerializeTaggedProperties(
 *             Archive, reinterpret_cast<uint8*>(this), Struct, nullptr);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Struct-specific serialization code goes here.
 * }

	// Old comment about this:
	/*
	 * The ComponentReference supports caching of the RigidBodyComponent through the
	 * CacheCurrentComponentBody member function. Only call this once the RigidBodyReference has
	 * been fully formed, i.e., the OwningActor property set to the final Actor and when the
	 * referenced RigidBodyComponent has been given its final name. BeginPlay is often a good
	 * choice. Though beware that if the target Rigid Body is destroyed due to a Blueprint
	 * Reconstruction then the cache becomes a dangling pointer.
	 */
	// Another old comment:
	/*
	 * The following comment describe tha challenges of using caching in Component references.
	 * When we replaced the specialized Rigid Body Reference with the more general Component
	 * reference we did not port over caching. The contents of this comment should be considered
	 * if we ever decide to introduce caching again.
	 *
	 * This may be complicated. Normally, all the Components of an Actor exists when the first
	 * BeginPlay is called. Under those conditions it is possible to cache the the Component
	 * pointers.
	 *
	 * However, when editing Properties in the Details Panel during a Play In Editor session
	 * Unreal Engine creates and initializes one component at the time. Which means that this
	 * Constraint may get BeginPlay before the Rigid Body it is attached to even exists. So
	 * caching in BeginPlay is not possible while the GIsReconstructingBlueprintInstances flag
	 * is set.
	 *
	 * Not sure where else to do it. I don't know of any later startup callback. Should we skip
	 * caching all together, and do a search every time we need the Component? Should we use the
	 * OldToNew map passed to Component Instance Data to update the pointers? Set a flag in the
	 * RigidBody/Component Reference to indicate that it is allowed to cache the next time a
	 * look-up is done?
	 *
	 * Things are made even more complicated if the Rigid Body or Component we're referencing
	 * is in another Blueprint and that Blueprint is being recreated. Nothing in that Blueprint
	 * knows that this Constraint needs to be notified about the reconstruction.
